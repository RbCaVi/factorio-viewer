# factorio-viewer

A static site with a item and recipe browser for Factorio modpacks.

I have some other features planned:

* Recipe Calculator (like FactorioLab)
* Upload modpack
* Blueprint viewer/editor
* Modpack maker (for this)
* Wiki editor (MediaWiki) (original purpose for updating the Space Exploration wiki)

## Hosting
It's hosted on Github Pages at https://rbcavi.github.io/factorio-viewer/viewer.html

You can host it on your computer with a static HTML server.

`mods.json` is the configuration file. It has the following structure:
```
{
	"assetlocations":{
		"__default":"<url or relative path containing {}>",
		"<mod name>":"<url or relative path to asset folder>"
		...
	},
	"datalocations":{
		"<mod name>":{
			"data":"<url or relative path to data.json>",
			"locale":"<url or relative path to locale.json>",
		}
		...
	}
}
```

The `__default` key in `assetlocations` is the default place to find mod assets. `{}` is replaced by the name of the mod to get the asset folder for that mod.

`data.json` is a JSON dump of the `data` table inside Factorio.

`locale.json` is the locale entries as JSON:
```
{
	"en":{
		"item-name.iron_plate":"Iron Plate",
		...
	}
	...
}
```

`data.json`, `locale.json`, and the asset folders are generated by https://github.com/RbCaVi/get-factorio-data
